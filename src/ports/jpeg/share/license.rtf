LEGAL ISSUES\par

The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied,

 fitness for a particular purpose. This software is provided "AS IS", and
 you, its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.\par

Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this
 software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to
 these conditions:\par

(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then
 this README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty
 notice unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the
 original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.\par

(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
 documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the
 work of the Independent JPEG Group".\par

(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
 full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors
 accept NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.\par

\pard\sb200\f1\fs20
These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG
 code, not just to the unmodified library. If you use our work, you ought to
 acknowledge us.\par

Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company
 name in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products
 derived from it. This software may be referred to only as "the Independent
 JPEG Group's software".\par

We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis
 of commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are
 assumed by the product vendor.\par

The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files. To
 avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent (now expired), GIF reading
 support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified
 to produce "uncompressed GIFs". This technique does not use the LZW
 algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable
 by all standard GIF decoders.\par

We are required to state that "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the
 Copyright property of CompuServe Incorporated. GIF(sm) is a Service Mark
 property of CompuServe Incorporated."\par
